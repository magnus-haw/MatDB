Version 2.1 includes modules to compute porosity, volume fractions, and surface area. Two finite difference Laplace solvers have been implemented to compute the continuum tortuosity factor, effective thermal conductivity, and effective electrical conductivity. A random method has been developed to compute tortuosity factors from the continuum to rarefied regimes. Representative elementary volume analysis can be performed on each property. The software also includes a time-dependent, particle-based model for the oxidation of fibrous materials. PuMA was developed for Linux operating systems and is available as a NASA software under a US &amp; Foreign release.</p>", "image": "Screen_Shot_2021-01-28_at_5.11.28_PM.png"}}, {"model": "software.softwareversion", "pk": 1, "fields": {"created_at": "2021-01-22T06:01:08.887Z", "last_modified": "2021-03-04", "modified_by": 1, "software": 1, "version": "2.3.0", "version_value": 203000000, "published": "2019-09-27", "link": "http://pato.ac/index.php/nasa-release/", "short_description": null, "lead_developer": null, "other_contact": null, "version_changes": "<p>Release notes :</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Minor bug fixes (JL, JM, JoM, JT, JF, CL)&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Streamlined code architecture : material model divided into 10 sub-models and fluid model divided into 5 types (JM)</li>\r\n\t<li>New utilities: patoManager (JM), unit-testing framework (JM, JF), sampling utility (JM)</li>\r\n\t<li>Third party librairies : update of OpenFoam to version 7 (JM)</li>\r\n\t<li>New solid model : solid mechanics (JL, MV, JM)</li>\r\n\t<li>New basic solvers : compressibleDarcy (JL), heatTransfer (JL), solidDisplacementPyrolysisFoam (JL, MV)</li>\r\n\t<li>New boundary conditions : solid mechanics BC for materials under pyrolysis (JL, MV)</li>\r\n\t<li>New tutorials: series of 0D tutorials (JM), graded materials (JM), stack of porous materials (JL, JM), 1D wood cylinder under pyrolysis (JL, CM), coupled material-flow simulations on 2D cylinders (JL, AA).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributions to version 2.3.0 : Jean Lachaud (JL), J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Meurisse (JM), Joshua Monk (JoM), John Thornton (JT), Joseph Ferguson (JF), Alexis Andr&eacute; (AA), Cyril Levet (CL), Cyrille M&eacute;tayer (CM), Marin Virey (MV).</p>"}}, {"model": "software.softwareversion", "pk": 2, "fields": {"created_at": "2021-01-22T06:01:19.673Z", "last_modified": "2021-03-04", "modified_by": 1, "software": 2, "version": "3", "version_value": 300000000, "published": "2021-01-28", "link": "https://software.nasa.gov/software/ARC-15779-1A", "short_description": "Simulates one-dimensional thermal energy transport in a multilayer stack of isotropic materials and structures that can ablate from the front surface and decompose in depth.", "lead_developer": null, "other_contact": null, "version_changes": "<p>Release notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Compilation bug fixes for Mac and Linux</li>\r\n\t<li>Preview of features in development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}}, {"model": "software.softwareversion", "pk": 3, "fields": {"created_at": "2021-01-22T06:01:29.102Z", "last_modified": "2021-03-04", "modified_by": 1, "software": 3, "version": "0.1", "version_value": 1000000, "published": "2021-01-28", "link": null, "short_description": "Icarus, is a three dimensional, unstructured material response tool that is intended to be used for design while maintaining the flexibility to easily implement physical models as needed", "lead_developer": null, "other_contact": null, "version_changes": "<p>Release notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Compilation bug fixes for Mac and Linux</li>\r\n\t<li>Preview of features in development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}}, {"model": "software.softwareversion", "pk": 4, "fields": {"created_at": "2021-01-22T06:06:23.108Z", "last_modified": "2021-03-04", "modified_by": 1, "software": 1, "version": "2.3.1", "version_value": 203010000, "published": "2020-11-06", "link": "http://pato.ac/index.php/nasa-release/", "short_description": "Latest version, some bug fixes", "lead_developer": null, "other_contact": null, "version_changes": "<p>Release notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Compilation bug fixes for Mac and Linux</li>\r\n\t<li>Preview of features in development</li>\r\n</ul>"}}, {"model": "software.softwareversion", "pk": 5, "fields": {"created_at": "2021-03-04T22:58:30.527Z", "last_modified": "2021-03-04", "modified_by": 1, "software": 4, "version": "0.1", "version_value": 1000000, "published": "2021-03-04", "link": null, "short_description": null, "lead_developer": null, "other_contact": null, "version_changes": ""}}]
